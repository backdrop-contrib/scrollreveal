Scroll Reveal
=============

A simple way to create and maintain how elements fade in, triggered when they
enter the viewport. This module bundles and uses the
[ScrollReveal](https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollreveal) plugin from
[Julian Lloyd](https://github.com/jlmakes).

  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.
